        "question": "Explain the two phases of annuities?",
        "answer": "The two phases of annuities are the accumulation phase and the annuitization phase. In the accumulation phase, the investor makes contributions to the annuity, and earnings grow tax-deferred. In the annuitization phase, the accumulated value is converted into a series of income payments to the annuitant, typically for life or a specified period."
      },      
      {
        "question": "How are annuities taxed?",
        "answer": "Annuities grow tax-deferred, meaning earnings within the annuity are not taxed until they are withdrawn. When distributions occur, they are taxed on a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) basis—meaning earnings are considered withdrawn first and are taxed as ordinary income. If withdrawals are made before age 59½, they may also be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty."
      },      
      {
        "question": "What is the exclusion ratio for annuities?",
        "answer": "The exclusion ratio is used to determine the portion of each annuity payment that is considered a tax-free return of the original investment (cost basis) and the portion that is taxable earnings. It applies to non-qualified annuities and spreads the tax liability over the expected payout period. Once the entire investment has been recovered, future payments are fully taxable as ordinary income."
      },      
      {
        "question": "What is the 1035 exchange?",
        "answer": "A 1035 exchange allows the tax-free transfer of funds from one insurance or annuity contract to another without triggering a taxable event. It must be between like-kind contracts—such as from one annuity to another, or from a life insurance policy to another life policy or an annuity. The purpose is to let policyholders upgrade or change their contracts while preserving the tax-deferred status of their investment."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the suitability requirements for variable annuities (VAs) (4)?",
        "answer": "VA is for retirement income, not more immediate purposes (education funding). VA is a supplement to retirement income. VA is not a preservation of capital. VA should not be used inside another tax-advantaged account like IRA or 401k."

      {
        "question": "Explain how long and short margin accounts work.",
        "answer": "Long and short margin accounts allow investors to borrow money or securities to amplify potential returns. In a long margin account, an investor borrows funds from a broker to purchase securities, using the securities as collateral—this enables the investor to control more shares than they could with cash alone. Interest is charged on the borrowed funds. In a short margin account, the investor borrows securities (typically from the broker) and sells them, aiming to repurchase them later at a lower price—profiting from a price decline. The investor must maintain sufficient margin to cover potential losses, and margin calls may occur if the account value drops below regulatory or broker requirements."
      },
      {
        "question": "What types of accounts are not permitted to be margin accounts?",
        "answer": "Custodial accounts (such as UTMA/UGMA accounts), retirement accounts (like IRAs, 401(k)s, and other qualified plans), and most trust accounts unless explicitly authorized are not permitted. These accounts are designed for long-term savings or for the benefit of minors, and borrowing against them would conflict with their intended purpose or violate tax rules."

        "question": "Explain the 3 A's of discretionary trading and what is not discretionary trading.",
        "answer": "The 3 A's of discretionary trading are **Asset**, **Action**, and **Amount**. If a registered representative chooses any of these three on behalf of the client—such as what security to buy (Asset), whether to buy or sell (Action), or how many shares (Amount)—it is considered a discretionary trade and requires written discretionary authority. Simply selecting the time or price of execution does *not* make a trade discretionary; this is known as Time and Price discretion, which does not require written authorization but must be executed on the same day."
      },
      {
        "question": "Explain the Reg T initial margin requirement.",
        "answer": "The Reg T initial margin requirement is a Federal Reserve rule that mandates that an investor must deposit at least 50% of the purchase price of securities when buying on margin. The remaining 50% can be borrowed from the broker. This requirement is designed to limit excessive leverage and protect the financial system."
      },
      {
        "question": "Explain the FINRA maintenance margin requirement.",
        "answer": "The FINRA maintenance margin requirement is the minimum amount of equity an investor must maintain in a margin account after purchasing securities. FINRA rules typically require investors to maintain at least 25% of the total market value of the securities in the account. If the account equity falls below this threshold due to market declines, a margin call may be issued, requiring the investor to deposit additional funds or sell securities to restore the required level."
      },
      {
        "question": "For joint accounts, what are the two types of joint ownership structures? Explain each one.",
        "answer": "The two main types are **Joint Tenants with Right of Survivorship (JTWROS)** and **Tenants in Common (TIC)**. In a JTWROS account, if one owner dies, their share passes automatically to the surviving owner(s). All parties have equal ownership and rights to the account. In a TIC account, each owner has a defined percentage of ownership, and their share passes to their estate upon death—not to the other account holders."
      },
      {
        "question": "Explain the two types of custodian minor accounts.",
        "answer": "The two types of minor accounts are **Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA)** and **Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)** accounts. Both are custodial accounts established for the benefit of a minor, where an adult acts as custodian. UGMA accounts allow only financial assets like cash, stocks, and bonds, while UTMA accounts can include a wider range of assets, such as real estate and patents. Assets in both types of accounts are irrevocably gifted to the minor and are transferred to them when they reach the age of majority as defined by state law."

        "question": "What is a 529 plan?",
        "answer": "A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings plan designed to encourage saving for future education expenses. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, grow tax-deferred, and can be withdrawn tax-free when used for qualified education expenses such as tuition, fees, books, and room and board."
      },      
      {
        "question": "What are the two types of 529 plans?",
        "answer": "The two types of 529 plans are prepaid tuition plans and education savings plans. Prepaid tuition plans allow individuals to purchase future tuition at today's rates, typically limited to in-state public colleges. Education savings plans, on the other hand, allow funds to be invested in various portfolios and used for a broader range of qualified education expenses, including tuition, fees, books, and room and board at most accredited colleges and universities nationwide."
      },      
      {
        "question": "When should you choose a college savings plan and when should you choose a prepaid tuition plan?",
        "answer": "You should choose a college savings plan when you want flexibility in how and where the funds can be used, including for out-of-state and private institutions, and the potential for investment growth. A prepaid tuition plan is best when you want to lock in today's tuition rates at in-state public colleges and prefer a lower-risk option that focuses specifically on covering tuition and mandatory fees."
      },      
      {
        "question": "What is ABLE?",
        "answer": "ABLE (Achieving a Better Life Experience) is a tax-advantaged savings account designed for individuals with disabilities. It allows eligible individuals to save and invest money for qualified disability expenses without affecting their eligibility for government benefits such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Contributions are made with after-tax dollars and grow tax-free. To qualify, the disability must have begun before age 26. Only one ABLE account is allowed per beneficiary, and up to $100,000 in the account is exempt from the SSI asset limit."
      },      
      {
        "question": "How does ABLE help with Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid?",
        "answer": "ABLE accounts help individuals with disabilities maintain eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid by allowing them to save up to $100,000 without the funds counting toward the SSI asset limit. If the account balance exceeds $100,000, SSI benefits are suspended but not terminated, and Medicaid eligibility remains unaffected regardless of the account balance. This allows disabled individuals to save for disability-related expenses while preserving vital government assistance."

      {
        "question": "Explain what a traditional IRA is, covering contributions, distributions, RMDs, and penalties.",
        "answer": "A Traditional IRA is a tax-advantaged retirement savings account that allows individuals to contribute earned income and deduct those contributions from taxable income. The account grows tax-deferred until withdrawals are made in retirement as ordinary income. Traditional IRAs have required minimum distributions that start on the year the owner turns 73. Penalties include 10% if distributions are taken before the age of 59½ and penalties if RMDs are not distributed."
      },
      {
        "question": "Explain transfers, rollovers, and direct rollovers",
        "answer": "Transfers, rollovers, and direct rollovers are ways to move retirement funds between accounts without triggering taxes or penalties when done correctly. A transfer typically occurs between like-accounts (e.g., IRA to IRA) and is done directly between custodians without the account holder receiving the funds. A rollover involves withdrawing funds from one retirement account and redepositing them into another within 60 days; if not completed in time, it may be taxed and penalized. A direct rollover specifically refers to moving funds from an employer-sponsored plan (like a 401(k)) directly to an IRA or another qualified plan, where the money is sent directly between institutions—avoiding mandatory withholding and ensuring tax-deferred status."
      },
      {
        "question": "Explain what a Roth IRA is, covering contributions, distributions, limitations, and penalties.",
        "answer": "A Roth IRA is a type of individual retirement account that allows for tax-free growth and tax-free withdrawals in retirement. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, meaning they are not tax-deductible. Qualified distributions—those taken after age 59½ and after the account has been open for at least 5 years—are entirely tax-free. Contribution limits are set annually by the IRS and may be reduced or eliminated based on income, using Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI). For 2024, the contribution limit is $7,000, or $8,000 if age 50 or older. However, direct contributions begin to phase out for single filers with MAGI over $146,000 and are completely phased out at $161,000; for married couples filing jointly, the phase-out starts at $230,000 and ends at $240,000. Early withdrawals of earnings (before age 59½ and without a qualified reason) may incur income taxes and a 10% penalty, while contributions can be withdrawn at any time without taxes or penalties."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a Backdoor Roth IRA?",
        "answer": "The Backdoor IRA is a legal workaround that allows high-income earners to contribute to a Roth IRA even if they exceed the income limits for direct contributions. It involves first making a non-deductible contribution to a Traditional IRA and then converting that amount into a Roth IRA. Because Roth IRA income limits do not apply to conversions, this allows the funds to grow and be withdrawn tax-free in retirement. However, if the investor has other pre-tax IRA assets, the pro-rata rule applies, which may result in part of the conversion being taxable. This strategy is most effective when the individual has no other Traditional IRA balances."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a defined benefit plan and who takes on the risk?",
        "answer": "A defined benefit plan is a type of employer-sponsored retirement plan that promises a specific monthly benefit to employees upon retirement, typically based on a formula that factors in salary history and years of service. Unlike defined contribution plans, where the employee bears the investment risk, in a defined benefit plan the employer is responsible for funding the plan and ensuring there is enough money to pay out promised benefits. This means the employer assumes the investment risk and the obligation to meet future retirement payouts, regardless of market performance."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a defined contribution plan and who takes on the risk?",
        "answer": "A defined contribution plan is a type of retirement plan in which the employee, employer, or both make regular contributions to an individual account for the employee. Common examples include 401(k) and 403(b) plans. The final retirement benefit depends on the amount contributed and the investment performance of the account. Unlike defined benefit plans, the employee bears the investment risk—meaning the value of the retirement savings can fluctuate based on market performance. The employer’s responsibility is limited to making the agreed-upon contributions, not guaranteeing a specific payout at retirement."

      {
        "question": "Explain a 401(k) Plan, covering who it's for, who contributes, 2024 contribution limit, total annual limit, withdrawals, and RMDs.",
        "answer": "A 401(k) plan is a tax-advantaged, employer-sponsored retirement plan primarily designed for employees of private companies. Employees contribute a portion of their salary on a pre-tax basis (traditional) or post-tax basis (Roth 401(k)), and many employers choose to match a percentage of those contributions. For 2024, the employee contribution limit is $23,000, with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution allowed for those age 50 and older. The total annual contribution limit—including employee and employer contributions—is $69,000 (or $76,500 with catch-up). Withdrawals taken before age 59½ may be subject to income taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty unless an exception applies. Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) must begin at age 73, unless the employee is still working and not a 5% owner of the business."

      {
        "question": "Explain a 403(b) Plan, covering who it's for, who contributes, 2024 contribution limit, total annual limit, withdrawals, and RMDs.",
        "answer": "A 403(b) plan is a tax-advantaged retirement plan available to employees of public schools, tax-exempt organizations, and certain ministers. Like a 401(k), it allows employees to make salary deferrals on a pre-tax (traditional) or post-tax (Roth) basis, and employers may also contribute. For 2024, the employee contribution limit is $23,000, with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution allowed for those age 50 and older. The total annual contribution limit—including both employee and employer contributions—is $69,000 (or $76,500 with catch-up). Withdrawals before age 59½ may be subject to income taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty unless an exception applies. Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) must begin at age 73, unless the participant is still working and not a 5% owner."

        "question": "Explain a Profit-Sharing Plan, covering who it's for, who contributes, 2024 contribution limit, total annual limit, withdrawals, and RMDs.",
        "answer": "A Profit-Sharing Plan is a type of defined contribution retirement plan that allows employers to make discretionary contributions to employee retirement accounts, regardless of whether the company is profitable in a given year. It is typically used by businesses of all sizes to incentivize and reward employees. Only the employer contributes to the plan; employees do not make direct contributions. For 2024, the total annual contribution limit per employee is the lesser of 100% of compensation or $69,000, with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution allowed for employees age 50 and older. Contributions are tax-deferred, and withdrawals before age 59½ may be subject to income taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty unless an exception applies. Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) must begin at age 73."

        "question": "Explain a Money Purchase Pension Plan, covering who it's for, who contributes, 2024 contribution limit, total annual limit, withdrawals, and RMDs.",
        "answer": "A SIMPLE IRA (Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees) is a retirement plan designed for small businesses with 100 or fewer employees who earned at least $5,000 in compensation during the preceding year. Both employers and employees can contribute. In 2024, employees can contribute up to $16,000, with an additional $3,500 catch-up contribution allowed for those age 50 or older. Employers are generally required to either match employee contributions up to 3% of compensation or make a 2% nonelective contribution for all eligible employees. Total contributions cannot exceed these combined limits. Withdrawals before age 59½ are subject to income taxes and typically a 10% penalty—raised to 25% if taken within the first two years of participation. Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs) must begin at age 73."

        "question": "Explain what a SERP is, covering its purpose, who contributes, eligibility, taxation, portability, and how it differs from an IRA.",
        "answer": "A SERP (Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan) is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan used by employers to provide additional retirement benefits to select key executives. It is entirely employer-funded and offered as a way to retain and reward top talent. Eligibility is typically limited to highly compensated employees or executives. SERPs are not subject to the same IRS contribution limits as qualified plans like IRAs or 401(k)s. Contributions are not taxed to the executive until distributions are received, usually in retirement, at which point they are taxed as ordinary income. SERPs are not portable—benefits generally cannot be rolled into an IRA or taken to another employer. Unlike IRAs, which are individual and tax-advantaged savings accounts open to most people, SERPs are employer-controlled, not funded by the employee, and do not offer the same ownership or portability."

      {
        "question": "Explain the concept of 'negative convexity' or 'price compression' along with what type of securities it's linked to.",
        "answer": "Negative convexity means that a bond's price falls faster as yields rise than it rises when yields fall. This term is usually linked with mortgage backed securities (MBSs) and callable bonds because the homeowner and issuer can refinance when rates drop."
      },
      {
        "question": "Explain the concept of 'positive convexity'.",
        "answer": "Positive convexity means that a bond's price increases more when rates fall than it decreases when rates rise by the same amount. This term is usually linked to standard bonds."

      },
      {
        "question": "Explain bond duration",
        "answer": "Bond duration is a measure of a bond's sensitivity to changes in interest rates, expressed in years. It estimates how much a bond's price will change in response to a 1% change in interest rates. The higher the duration, the more sensitive the bond is to interest rate movements."
      },

        "answer": "BBB/Baa or better"
      },
      {
        "question": "Why can bonds with a shorter duration be seen as a defensive investment?",
        "answer": "Bonds with a shorter duration are considered a defensive investment because they are less sensitive to interest rate changes and experience smaller price fluctuations. This makes them more stable in uncertain or rising interest rate environments. Additionally, shorter-duration bonds return principal to investors more quickly, allowing them to reinvest at potentially higher interest rates, providing greater flexibility and lower market risk."

      },
      {
        "question": "What is the difference between a bond's duration and convexity?",
        "answer": "Duration measures a bond’s sensitivity to interest rate changes assuming a linear relationship, providing an estimate of how much a bond’s price will change for a given change in interest rates. Convexity, on the other hand, accounts for the curvature in the bond’s price-yield relationship and measures how the duration itself changes as interest rates change. While duration gives a first-order approximation of price changes, convexity provides a more accurate estimate, especially for larger interest rate movements."
      },      
      {
        "question": "Explain how bonds with higher convexity are affected by rate increases and decreases",
        "answer": "Bonds with higher convexity are less affected by interest rate increases and benefit more from interest rate decreases. When rates rise, these bonds experience smaller price declines compared to bonds with lower convexity. Conversely, when rates fall, bonds with higher convexity see larger price gains. This characteristic makes high-convexity bonds more attractive in volatile interest rate environments as they offer better price performance under both rising and falling rate scenarios."

        "question": "Describe the different mutual fund classes including their sales charges, expense ratios, what they're best for and any notes",
        "answer": "Class A shares typically have a front-end sales load, meaning a commission is charged at the time of purchase. They offer lower ongoing expense ratios and are best suited for long-term investors who can benefit from breakpoint discounts. \n\nClass B shares have a back-end sales charge (Contingent Deferred Sales Charge or CDSC) that decreases over time and eventually disappears. They often have higher expense ratios and convert to Class A shares after a certain period; best for investors who plan to hold for the long term but lack initial investment amounts for breakpoints.\n\nClass C shares have no front-end load but impose a small CDSC if sold within a short period (usually 1 year). They carry higher ongoing expense ratios and are best for short- to medium-term investors.\n\nClass I shares are institutional class shares with no sales loads and the lowest expense ratios. They are typically only available to institutional investors or high-net-worth individuals with large investment minimums.\n\nClass R shares are typically offered in retirement plans like 401(k)s. They usually have no sales charges but can have varying expense ratios depending on the plan.\n\nNo-load shares have no sales charges and are sold directly by investment companies without brokers. They generally have lower expense ratios and are ideal for cost-conscious, self-directed investors."

        "question": "Explain puttable bonds, including who has the option, investor and issuer benefits, typical yield, market sensitivity, and when they are exercised.",
        "answer": "Puttable bonds give investors the right to sell the bond back to the issuer before maturity at a specified price. The investor holds the option, providing protection against rising interest rates and deteriorating issuer credit. The issuer benefits by offering a lower coupon rate due to this protection. Puttable bonds typically have lower yields compared to non-puttable bonds and show lower sensitivity to interest rate increases since investors can exit early. They are usually exercised when interest rates rise significantly or the issuer’s financial condition worsens."

        "answer": "Callable bonds allow the issuer to redeem the bond before maturity at a specified call price. The issuer holds the option and benefits by refinancing debt at lower interest rates if market rates decline. Investors receive higher yields to compensate for the call risk. Callable bonds have higher sensitivity to falling interest rates but limited price appreciation since they are often called when rates drop. These bonds are typically exercised when interest rates fall significantly, allowing the issuer to refinance at a lower cost."

      {
        "question": "What are key factors in the volatility of bonds?",
        "answer": "The key factors affecting bond volatility include maturity, coupon rate, and credit quality. Bonds with longer maturities are more volatile because their cash flows are spread over a longer period, making them more sensitive to interest rate changes. Bonds with lower coupon rates are more volatile since a larger portion of their value is tied to the final principal payment, increasing duration. Lower credit quality bonds tend to be more volatile due to higher default risk and greater sensitivity to market sentiment. Additionally, bonds with embedded options, like callable or puttable features, can also experience increased volatility based on the likelihood of the option being exercised."

ADRs are important because they allow U.S. investors to easily invest in foreign companies without dealing with the complexities of international markets. To create an ADR, first, a US depository bank purchases common shares in a foreign company in a foreign company's home market. Second, the purchased shares are deposited in a foreign branch of the bank. Third, the deposits have a receipt issued. Fourth, each ADR represents one or more shares of the foreign company's shares held on deposit."

Unlike stock options, warrants are issued directly by the company and result in new shares when exercised. Key features of warrants include their typically longer time to expiration (often several years), their leverage potential, and their dilutive effect when exercised. Companies use warrants to attract investors, especially in conjunction with bond or preferred stock offerings, as they act as a 'sweetener' to make the deal more appealing. Warrants can also be used in mergers or to raise capital without immediately issuing new equity."

        "question": "Explain what stock rights are and how they work.",
        "answer": "Stock rights (also known as preemptive rights or subscription rights) are short-term privileges that allow existing shareholders to purchase additional shares of a company’s stock—usually at a discount—before the shares are offered to the public. These rights help shareholders maintain their proportional ownership in the company and typically have a short expiration window (e.g., 30 to 45 days). They are often transferable, meaning shareholders can sell them on the open market if they choose not to exercise them. Stock rights help companies raise capital while giving existing shareholders a first opportunity to invest further."

They can issue multiple classes of stock and offer stock-based compensation such as employee stock purchase plans (ESPP) and stock options. A major advantage is that C-corps can qualify for Section 1202 (Qualified Small Business Stock or QSBS), which allows investors to potentially exclude up to 100% of capital gains on the sale of stock if the shares are held for at least 5 years and other conditions are met. This makes C-corps highly attractive for startups and high-growth businesses. In contrast, S-corps are limited to 100 shareholders, must be U.S. individuals or certain trusts, and can only issue one class of stock, which limits their appeal for larger capital raises."

        "answer": "The business cycle consists of four main stages: expansion, peak, contraction, and trough. During the expansion phase, the economy grows as measured by increasing GDP, rising employment, and consumer demand. The peak represents very low unemployment, slowdown in inflation and slowing of GDP growth. Contraction (or recession) follows, characterized by declining GDP, rising unemployment, and reduced consumer spending. Finally, the trough marks the lowest point in the cycle, after which the economy begins to recover and re-enter expansion. These cycles are natural in market economies and influenced by factors such as monetary policy, consumer behavior, and global events."

      {
        "question": "Explain the differnce between a recession and a depression.",
        "answer": "A recession is a temporary economic decline typically identified by two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, rising unemployment, and decreased consumer spending. It is considered a normal part of the business cycle and can last from a few months to over a year. A depression, on the other hand, is a much more severe and prolonged downturn characterized by a sustained drop in economic activity, extremely high unemployment, widespread business failures, and significant deflation."

GNP (Gross National Product) includes GDP plus income earned by citizens and businesses abroad, minus income earned by foreigners domestically—giving a broader picture of a nation's economic performance. CPI (Consumer Price Index) tracks changes in the average price of a basket of consumer goods and services over time, serving as a key indicator of inflation and cost of living. Together, these metrics provide insight into economic growth, national income, and inflation trends."

Coincident indicators change at the same time as the economy and reflect the current state; examples include employment levels, personal income, and industrial production. Lagging indicators change after the economy has already begun to follow a particular trend and help confirm patterns; examples include unemployment rates, corporate profits, and interest rates."

Cyclical industries perform well during economic expansions and poorly during recessions, such as automotive and construction. Non-cyclical (defensive) industries provide essential goods and services and remain stable across economic cycles, including sectors like utilities, food, and healthcare. Counter-cyclical industries tend to perform better during economic downturns, such as discount retailers or debt collection firms. Growth or special situation industries are characterized by unique factors—such as innovation, new products, or restructuring—that drive strong performance regardless of the economic cycle."

It shows what the company owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and the owner's equity (the residual interest in the assets after deducting liabilities). The balance sheet follows the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders’ Equity. Key components include current and non-current assets (like cash, inventory, and property), current and long-term liabilities (such as accounts payable and debt), and equity items like retained earnings, common stock, preferred stock, capital in excess of par."

        "question": "What are three short-term and one long-term liquidity formulas to analyze a company's balance sheet and liquidity. Include the equation and significance of each formula.",
        "answer": "The three key short-term liquidity formulas are: (1) **Working Capital** = Current Assets - Current Liabilities. It represents the short-term financial buffer a company has to cover operational needs. Positive working capital indicates healthy liquidity. (2) **Current Ratio** = Current Assets / Current Liabilities. It measures the company’s ability to pay off its short-term obligations with its short-term assets. A ratio above 1 is generally favorable. (3) **Acid-Test (Quick) Ratio** = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities. This evaluates a company’s ability to meet short-term liabilities using its most liquid assets. The one long-term liquidity formula is: (4) **Debt Ratio** = Total Liabilities / Total Assets. It measures the proportion of a company’s assets that are financed by debt, reflecting long-term solvency and financial risk."

It details how much revenue a company earned and the costs associated with earning that revenue. Key components include: (1) **Revenue (or Sales)** – total income from goods or services sold, (2) **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** – direct costs of producing the goods or services, (3) **Gross Profit** – revenue minus COGS, (4) **Operating Expenses** – indirect costs such as salaries, rent, and utilities, (5) **Operating Income** – gross profit minus operating expenses, (6) **Other Income/Expenses** – non-operating items like interest or investment income, and (7) **Net Income** – the final profit after all expenses, taxes, and interest are deducted from total revenue."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the two ratios to analyze an income statement and what do they measure?",
        "answer": "Two common ratios used to analyze an income statement are Earnings Per Share (EPS) and the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio. **EPS** measures how much profit is allocated to each outstanding share of common stock and is calculated as Net Income minus Preferred Dividends divided by the number of Common Shares Outstanding. It reflects the company’s profitability on a per-share basis. **P/E Ratio** compares a company's stock price to its EPS and is calculated as Market Price per Share divided by EPS. It shows how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings and is used to assess whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued relative to its earnings."

        "question": "Describe how a strong and weak USD impacts the balance of payments for the USA.",
        "answer": "A strong U.S. dollar makes American goods and services more expensive for foreign buyers, which can reduce U.S. exports and increase imports, leading to a trade deficit and a negative impact on the balance of payments. Conversely, a weak U.S. dollar makes American exports cheaper and imports more expensive, which can boost exports, reduce imports, and improve the trade balance, positively affecting the balance of payments. Therefore, currency strength influences international demand for goods and the overall flow of money into and out of the country."

        "question": "Explain fiscal and monetary policy including Keynesian and Supply-Side Theories.",
        "answer": "Fiscal policy involves government decisions on taxation and spending to influence economic activity. Expansionary fiscal policy (increased spending or tax cuts) is used to stimulate growth, while contractionary policy (reduced spending or tax increases) slows inflation. Monetary policy, managed by the Federal Reserve, involves controlling the money supply and interest rates. Lower interest rates encourage borrowing and spending, while higher rates slow the economy to control inflation. Keynesian theory supports active government intervention through fiscal policy to manage demand and smooth economic cycles. In contrast, Supply-Side theory emphasizes tax cuts and deregulation to incentivize production, arguing that economic growth comes from boosting supply rather than demand."

The three diagnostic tools are the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and unemployment data—these help evaluate inflation, growth, and labor market health. The three direct tools are the reserve requirement (the percentage of deposits banks must hold in reserve), the discount rate (interest rate the Fed charges banks for short-term loans), and open market operations (buying or selling government securities to influence the money supply). By adjusting these tools, the Fed can either stimulate or contract the economy to meet its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment."

M2 includes all of M1 plus less liquid forms like savings accounts, money market accounts, and small time deposits under $100,000. M3 includes all of M2 plus large time deposits, institutional money market funds, and other large liquid assets.

If any capital losses remain, up to $3,000 per year can be used to offset ordinary (earned) income, with the remainder carried forward indefinitely. Net operating losses (NOLs), typically from business income, can offset ordinary 80% of earned income but generally cannot offset capital gains unless the gains are directly connected to the business that generated the NOL. NOLs can be carried forward to offset future taxable income."

Unused passive losses can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future passive income."

The IRS disallows the loss for tax purposes in these cases, meaning the investor cannot claim the loss on their taxes. Instead, the disallowed loss is added to the cost basis of the repurchased security, deferring the tax benefit until a future sale."

SARs must be filed within 30 days of detecting the suspicious activity, and the subject of the report must not be notified."

Firms must train staff to recognize signs of diminished capacity and financial exploitation. They are encouraged to collect a 'trusted contact person' to reach in case of concerns. FINRA Rule 2165 allows firms to place temporary holds on disbursements if financial exploitation is suspected, and Rule 4512 requires firms to make reasonable efforts to obtain the trusted contact info."

        "question": "What is the use of temporary holds?",
        "answer": "Temporary holds are permitted under FINRA Rule 2165 and are used to protect senior investors (age 65 or older) or vulnerable adults from financial exploitation. If a firm reasonably suspects exploitation, it may place a temporary hold on disbursements of funds or securities from the customer's account. The firm must immediately notify the customer and their trusted contact, and the hold typically lasts up to 15 business days (with potential extensions). This rule empowers firms to proactively protect clients while investigating suspicious activity."

Municipal Finance Professionals (MFPs) are subject to strict contribution limits. An MFP may contribute up to $250 per election to a candidate for whom they are entitled to vote.
