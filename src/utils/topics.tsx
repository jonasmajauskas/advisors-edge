        "id": 1,
        "question": "Explain the two phases of annuities?",
        "answer": "The two phases of annuities are the accumulation phase and the annuitization phase. In the accumulation phase, the investor makes contributions to the annuity, and earnings grow tax-deferred. In the annuitization phase, the accumulated value is converted into a series of income payments to the annuitant, typically for life or a specified period."
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "question": "How are annuities taxed?",
        "answer": "Annuities grow tax-deferred, meaning earnings within the annuity are not taxed until they are withdrawn. When distributions occur, they are taxed on a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) basis—meaning earnings are considered withdrawn first and are taxed as ordinary income. If withdrawals are made before age 59½, they may also be subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty."
      },
      {
        "id": 3,
        "question": "What is the exclusion ratio for annuities?",
        "answer": "The exclusion ratio is used to determine the portion of each annuity payment that is considered a tax-free return of the original investment (cost basis) and the portion that is taxable earnings. It applies to non-qualified annuities and spreads the tax liability over the expected payout period. Once the entire investment has been recovered, future payments are fully taxable as ordinary income."
      },
      {
        "id": 4,
        "question": "What is the 1035 exchange?",
        "answer": "A 1035 exchange allows the tax-free transfer of funds from one insurance or annuity contract to another without triggering a taxable event. It must be between like-kind contracts—such as from one annuity to another, or from a life insurance policy to another life policy or an annuity. The purpose is to let policyholders upgrade or change their contracts while preserving the tax-deferred status of their investment."

      {
        "id": 5,
        "question": "What are the suitability requirements for variable annuities (VAs) (4)?",
        "answer": "VA is for retirement income, not more immediate purposes (education funding). VA is a supplement to retirement income. VA is not a preservation of capital. VA should not be used inside another tax-advantaged account like IRA or 401k."

        "question": "Explain how long and short margin accounts work.",
        "answer": "Long and short margin accounts allow investors to borrow money or securities to amplify potential returns. In a long margin account, an investor borrows funds from a broker to purchase securities, using the securities as collateral—this enables the investor to control more shares than they could with cash alone. Interest is charged on the borrowed funds. In a short margin account, the investor borrows securities (typically from the broker) and sells them, aiming to repurchase them later at a lower price—profiting from a price decline. The investor must maintain sufficient margin to cover potential losses, and margin calls may occur if the account value drops below regulatory or broker requirements."

        "id": 10,
        "question": "What types of accounts are not permitted to be margin accounts?",
        "answer": "Custodial accounts (such as UTMA/UGMA accounts), retirement accounts (like IRAs, 401(k)s, and other qualified plans), and most trust accounts unless explicitly authorized are not permitted. These accounts are designed for long-term savings or for the benefit of minors, and borrowing against them would conflict with their intended purpose or violate tax rules."

        "question": "Explain the 3 A's of discretionary trading and what is not discretionary trading.",
        "answer": "The 3 A's of discretionary trading are **Asset**, **Action**, and **Amount**. If a registered representative chooses any of these three on behalf of the client—such as what security to buy (Asset), whether to buy or sell (Action), or how many shares (Amount)—it is considered a discretionary trade and requires written discretionary authority. Simply selecting the time or price of execution does *not* make a trade discretionary; this is known as Time and Price discretion, which does not require written authorization but must be executed on the same day."
      },

        "id": 12,
        "question": "Explain the Reg T initial margin requirement.",
        "answer": "The Reg T initial margin requirement is a Federal Reserve rule that mandates that an investor must deposit at least 50% of the purchase price of securities when buying on margin. The remaining 50% can be borrowed from the broker. This requirement is designed to limit excessive leverage and protect the financial system."
      },
      {
        "id": 13,
        "question": "Explain the FINRA maintenance margin requirement.",
        "answer": "The FINRA maintenance margin requirement is the minimum amount of equity an investor must maintain in a margin account after purchasing securities. FINRA rules typically require investors to maintain at least 25% of the total market value of the securities in the account. If the account equity falls below this threshold due to market declines, a margin call may be issued, requiring the investor to deposit additional funds or sell securities to restore the required level."

        "id": 14,
        "question": "For joint accounts, what are the two types of joint ownership structures? Explain each one.",
        "answer": "The two main types are **Joint Tenants with Right of Survivorship (JTWROS)** and **Tenants in Common (TIC)**. In a JTWROS account, if one owner dies, their share passes automatically to the surviving owner(s). All parties have equal ownership and rights to the account. In a TIC account, each owner has a defined percentage of ownership, and their share passes to their estate upon death—not to the other account holders."

        "question": "Explain the two types of custodian minor accounts.",
        "answer": "The two types of minor accounts are **Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA)** and **Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)** accounts. Both are custodial accounts established for the benefit of a minor, where an adult acts as custodian. UGMA accounts allow only financial assets like cash, stocks, and bonds, while UTMA accounts can include a wider range of assets, such as real estate and patents. Assets in both types of accounts are irrevocably gifted to the minor and are transferred to them when they reach the age of majority as defined by state law."

        "question": "What is a 529 plan?",
        "answer": "A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings plan designed to encourage saving for future education expenses. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, grow tax-deferred, and can be withdrawn tax-free when used for qualified education expenses such as tuition, fees, books, and room and board. In some states, contributions may be eligible for a state tax deduction."

      {
        "id": 17,
        "question": "What are the two types of 529 plans?",
        "answer": "The two types of 529 plans are prepaid tuition plans and education savings plans. Prepaid tuition plans allow individuals to purchase future tuition at today's rates, typically limited to in-state public colleges. Education savings plans, on the other hand, allow funds to be invested in various portfolios and used for a broader range of qualified education expenses, including tuition, fees, books, and room and board at most accredited colleges and universities nationwide."
      },
      {
        "id": 18,
        "question": "When should you choose a college savings plan and when should you choose a prepaid tuition plan?",
        "answer": "You should choose a college savings plan when you want flexibility in how and where the funds can be used, including for out-of-state and private institutions, and the potential for investment growth. A prepaid tuition plan is best when you want to lock in today's tuition rates at in-state public colleges and prefer a lower-risk option that focuses specifically on covering tuition and mandatory fees."

      {
        "id": 19,
        "question": "What is ABLE?",
        "answer": "ABLE (Achieving a Better Life Experience) is a tax-advantaged savings account designed for individuals with disabilities. It allows eligible individuals to save and invest money for qualified disability expenses without affecting their eligibility for government benefits such as Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income (SSI). Contributions are made with after-tax dollars and grow tax-free. To qualify, the disability must have begun before age 26. Only one ABLE account is allowed per beneficiary, and up to $100,000 in the account is exempt from the SSI asset limit."
      },
      {
        "id": 20,
        "question": "How does ABLE help with Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid?",
        "answer": "ABLE accounts help individuals with disabilities maintain eligibility for Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and Medicaid by allowing them to save up to $100,000 without the funds counting toward the SSI asset limit. If the account balance exceeds $100,000, SSI benefits are suspended but not terminated, and Medicaid eligibility remains unaffected regardless of the account balance. This allows disabled individuals to save for disability-related expenses while preserving vital government assistance."

        "id": 21,
        "question": "Explain what a traditional IRA is, covering contributions, distributions, RMDs, and penalties.",
        "answer": "A Traditional IRA is a tax-advantaged retirement savings account that allows individuals to contribute earned income and deduct those contributions from taxable income. The account grows tax-deferred until withdrawals are made in retirement as ordinary income. Traditional IRAs have required minimum distributions (RMDs) starting the year the account holder turns 73. Early withdrawals before age 59½ incur a 10% penalty unless an exception applies, and missing RMDs results in a 25% penalty on the undistributed amount."
      },
      {
        "id": 22,
        "question": "Explain transfers, rollovers, and direct rollovers.",
        "answer": "Transfers, rollovers, and direct rollovers allow retirement funds to move between accounts tax-free when done properly. A transfer is a direct movement between similar accounts (e.g., IRA to IRA) without the account holder receiving funds. A rollover involves withdrawing funds and redepositing them into a new account within 60 days to avoid taxes and penalties. A direct rollover moves funds directly from one plan (like a 401(k)) to another (like an IRA), avoiding mandatory tax withholding and maintaining tax deferral."

      {
        "id": 23,
        "question": "Explain what a Roth IRA is, covering contributions, distributions, limitations, and penalties.",
        "answer": "A Roth IRA is a retirement account funded with after-tax dollars. Contributions are not tax-deductible, but qualified withdrawals are tax-free. Contributions can be withdrawn at any time without taxes or penalties. Earnings can be withdrawn tax-free if the account has been open for at least 5 years and the account holder is over 59½. For 2024, the contribution limit is $7,000 ($8,000 if age 50+). Contributions begin to phase out for single filers with MAGI over $146,000 and phase out completely at $161,000. Early withdrawals of earnings may be taxed and penalized unless exceptions apply."

      {
        "id": 24,
        "question": "What is a Backdoor Roth IRA?",
        "answer": "A Backdoor Roth IRA is a strategy allowing high-income earners to contribute to a Roth IRA despite income limits. It involves making a non-deductible contribution to a Traditional IRA and then converting those funds to a Roth IRA. This allows the investor to benefit from tax-free growth and withdrawals. However, if the investor holds other Traditional IRA assets, the pro-rata rule applies, potentially making part of the conversion taxable."

      {
        "id": 25,
        "question": "What is a defined benefit plan and who takes on the risk?",
        "answer": "A defined benefit plan promises a specific monthly retirement benefit, often based on salary and years of service. The employer bears the investment and funding risk, ensuring there are sufficient funds to meet the promised payouts regardless of market performance. These plans are often offered by large corporations and government entities."
      },
      {
        "id": 26,
        "question": "What is a defined contribution plan and who takes on the risk?",
        "answer": "A defined contribution plan, like a 401(k), allows employees and employers to contribute to an individual account. The final retirement benefit depends on the total contributions and investment performance. The employee bears the investment risk, as account value can fluctuate based on market conditions."

        "answer": "A 401(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan for private-sector employees. Employees can contribute up to $23,000 in 2024, with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution for those aged 50 and older. Employers may also contribute. The total annual limit (employee + employer) is $69,000 ($76,500 with catch-up). Withdrawals before age 59½ face a 10% penalty and income tax unless an exception applies. RMDs must start at age 73, unless the employee is still working and not a 5% owner."

        "answer": "A 403(b) plan is for employees of public schools, non-profits, and certain ministers. Employees can contribute up to $23,000 in 2024, with a $7,500 catch-up contribution for those 50 and older. Employers may also contribute, with a total annual limit of $69,000 ($76,500 with catch-up). Withdrawals before age 59½ face a 10% penalty unless exceptions apply.

        "answer": "A Profit-Sharing Plan allows employers to make discretionary contributions to employee retirement accounts. Employees typically do not contribute. For 2024, the total contribution limit is $69,000 per employee, or $76,500 with a $7,500 catch-up for those 50 and older. Withdrawals before 59½ are taxed and may incur a 10% penalty.

        "question": "Explain what a SERP is, covering its purpose, who contributes, eligibility, taxation, portability, and how it differs from an IRA.",
        "answer": "A SERP (Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan) is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan provided by employers to key executives. It is fully employer-funded and used to retain top talent. Contributions are not taxed until the executive receives distributions, typically at retirement. SERPs are non-portable and cannot be rolled into IRAs. Unlike IRAs, SERPs have no IRS contribution limits and are not employee-funded. They offer additional retirement benefits beyond standard qualified plans."

      { "id": 35, "question": "Explain 'bond yield'", "answer": "Bond yield is a return metric that measures a bond's interest payments in relation to its market value, helping investors assess income returns relative to current prices." },
      { "id": 36, "question": "What is the difference between the nominal and current yield?", "answer": "The nominal yield is the bond's stated coupon rate, while the current yield measures the bond's annual coupon payments relative to its current market price, providing a more real-time income return perspective." },
      { "id": 37, "question": "Explain 'Yield to Maturity'", "answer": "Yield to Maturity (YTM) is the total annualized return an investor can expect if the bond is held until it matures, accounting for all future coupon payments and the difference between purchase price and par value." },
      { "id": 38, "question": "What does convexity measure?", "answer": "Convexity measures how a bond's duration changes as interest rates change. It accounts for the non-linear relationship between bond prices and yields, improving price change estimates for large rate movements." },
      { "id": 39, "question": "Explain the concept of 'negative convexity' or 'price compression' along with what type of securities it's linked to.", "answer": "Negative convexity occurs when bond prices rise at a slower rate when yields fall but drop faster when yields rise. It is typically associated with mortgage-backed securities and callable bonds, where issuers or borrowers refinance when rates fall." },
      { "id": 40, "question": "Explain the concept of 'positive convexity'.", "answer": "Positive convexity means that a bond’s price increases more when interest rates fall than it decreases when rates rise by the same amount. Standard non-callable bonds usually exhibit positive convexity." },
      { "id": 41, "question": "What is the hierarchy of bond volatility risk?", "answer": "Zero-coupon bonds, Long-term bonds, High-yield bonds, Callable bonds, Investment-grade bonds, Short-term bonds." },
      { "id": 42, "question": "Explain bond duration", "answer": "Bond duration measures a bond’s sensitivity to interest rate changes, expressed in years. A higher duration means greater price sensitivity to rate changes. It estimates the percentage price change for a 1% change in interest rates." },
      { "id": 43, "question": "What bonds are considered investment grade from a rating perspective?", "answer": "Bonds rated BBB or Baa and higher by credit rating agencies are considered investment grade, indicating lower credit risk." },
      { "id": 44, "question": "Why can bonds with a shorter duration be seen as a defensive investment?", "answer": "Short-duration bonds are less sensitive to interest rate changes, experience lower price volatility, and return principal faster, allowing reinvestment at higher rates if rates rise. This makes them safer in uncertain environments." },
      { "id": 45, "question": "How can a strategy be defined based on bond's duration?", "answer": "Short duration bonds are used for defensive strategies focused on capital preservation, while long duration bonds are used for aggressive strategies to maximize returns when interest rates are expected to fall." },
      { "id": 46, "question": "What are the three key factors in calculating a bond's duration?", "answer": "Maturity, Coupon rate, and Yield to Maturity (YTM)." },
      { "id": 47, "question": "What is the difference between a bond's duration and convexity?", "answer": "Duration measures a bond’s price sensitivity to interest rate changes assuming a linear relationship. Convexity adjusts for the curvature in the price-yield relationship, providing more accurate estimates for larger rate changes." },
      { "id": 48, "question": "Explain how bonds with higher convexity are affected by rate increases and decreases.", "answer": "Bonds with higher convexity lose less value when rates rise and gain more value when rates fall compared to bonds with lower convexity. This makes them more attractive in volatile rate environments." },
      { "id": 49, "question": "Describe the different mutual fund classes including their sales charges, expense ratios, what they're best for and any notes.", "answer": "Class A: Front-end sales load, lower expense ratios, best for long-term investors using breakpoint discounts.\nClass B: Back-end sales load, higher expense ratios, convert to Class A over time, suitable for long-term investors without large upfront investments.\nClass C: No front-end load, small back-end load if sold early, higher expense ratios, good for short- to medium-term investors.\nClass I: No sales loads, lowest expense ratios, available to institutions and high-net-worth individuals.\nClass R: Offered through retirement plans, no sales charges, varying expense ratios.\nNo-Load: No sales charges, lower expense ratios, ideal for self-directed, cost-conscious investors." },

      { "id": 51, "question": "Define 'zero-coupon bonds'.", "answer": "Zero-coupon bonds are issued at a deep discount and mature at face value. They do not pay periodic interest—the difference between the purchase price and par value represents the investor’s return. They have the highest exposure to interest rate risk because they have the longest duration, with all of their value tied up in a single future payment. They also face significant inflation risk, particularly if long-term, since their lump-sum payment may lose purchasing power over time." },
      { "id": 52, "question": "Explain the tax payments for zero-coupon bonds.", "answer": "Even though zero-coupon bonds don’t pay periodic interest, investors must pay income tax each year on the imputed interest (phantom income) as it accrues. This income is taxed as ordinary income, not capital gains." },
      { "id": 53, "question": "What are the types of corporate bonds (7)?", "answer": "Debenture, Subordinated, Income, Convertible, High-Yield (Junk), Zero-Coupon, Collateralized bonds." },
      { "id": 54, "question": "Explain puttable bonds, including who has the option, investor and issuer benefits, typical yield, market sensitivity, and when they are exercised.", "answer": "Puttable bonds give investors the right to sell the bond back to the issuer before maturity at a set price. This benefits investors by providing downside protection if interest rates rise or the issuer’s credit weakens. Issuers can offer lower coupon rates due to this feature. These bonds generally have lower yields and are less sensitive to rising rates since investors can exit early. Investors exercise the option when rates rise or the issuer's financial condition deteriorates." },
      { "id": 55, "question": "Explain callable bonds, including who has the option, investor and issuer benefits, typical yield, market sensitivity, and when they are exercised.", "answer": "Callable bonds give the issuer the right to redeem the bond before maturity at a specified price. The issuer benefits by refinancing at lower rates if interest rates fall. Investors receive higher yields to compensate for this risk. These bonds have higher sensitivity to falling rates but limited price appreciation since they may be called when rates decline. They are usually called when interest rates drop significantly." },
      { "id": 56, "question": "What are key factors in the volatility of bonds?", "answer": "Bond volatility is driven by maturity (longer maturity means higher volatility), coupon rate (lower coupon increases volatility), and credit quality (lower credit quality increases volatility). Additionally, bonds with embedded options (callable or puttable) also experience volatility based on the likelihood of the option being exercised." },

        "id": 203,
        "question": "Why are asset-backed securities traded according to their average life rather than their stated maturity dates?",
        "answer": "Asset-backed securities (ABS) are traded based on their average life rather than their stated maturity dates because the underlying loans can be paid off earlier than expected, creating prepayment risk. This makes the actual timing of cash flows uncertain. Average life provides a more realistic measure of when investors are likely to receive principal repayments, helping them better assess cash flow timing and interest rate risk."

        "answer": "Time value represents the portion of an option's premium that is attributable to the amount of time remaining until expiration. The longer the time until expiration, the greater the chance the option could become profitable, which increases its time value. Time value diminishes as the expiration date approaches, a phenomenon known as time decay or theta decay. This value is subjective and driven by market supply and demand."

For call options, it’s the difference between the current market value of the underlying asset and the strike price, if the stock price is above the strike price. For put options, it’s the difference between the strike price and the current market value of the underlying asset, if the stock price is below the strike price.

        "answer": "A closing purchase is a transaction in the options market where an investor buys an option to close out or offset an existing short options position. This action effectively exits the position and realizes any profit or loss. For example, if an investor initially sold (wrote) a call option, they can later perform a closing purchase by buying back the same call option to close the position. This is done to limit potential losses, lock in profits, or exit before expiration."

        "answer": "Rule 144 and Rule 144A both relate to the resale of restricted and control securities but apply in different contexts and to different investors. \n\n- **Rule 144**: Governs the public resale of restricted and control securities, typically acquired through private placements or by company insiders. It sets holding periods (6 months to 1 year), volume limits, and disclosure requirements. Sellers must often file a Form 144 if the sale exceeds specified thresholds. This rule ensures the orderly resale of securities without disrupting markets.\n\n- **Rule 144A**: Facilitates the resale of restricted securities specifically to Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs) without requiring SEC registration. It is used primarily in private placements to allow faster capital raising for issuers and provides liquidity for institutional investors. Securities sold under 144A are typically not available to the general public.\n\nIn summary, Rule 144 applies to public resales by individuals and company insiders, while Rule 144A is for private resales to large institutional investors."

      { "id": 143, "question": "Explain the four stages of the business cycle and what they're impacted by.", "answer": "The business cycle consists of four main stages: expansion, peak, contraction, and trough. During the expansion phase, the economy grows as measured by increasing GDP, rising employment, and consumer demand. The peak represents very low unemployment, slowdown in inflation and slowing of GDP growth. Contraction (or recession) follows, characterized by declining GDP, rising unemployment, and reduced consumer spending. Finally, the trough marks the lowest point in the cycle, after which the economy begins to recover and re-enter expansion. These cycles are natural in market economies and influenced by factors such as monetary policy, consumer behavior, and global events." },
      { "id": 144, "question": "Explain the differnce between a recession and a depression.", "answer": "A recession is a temporary economic decline typically identified by two consecutive quarters of negative GDP growth, rising unemployment, and decreased consumer spending. It is considered a normal part of the business cycle and can last from a few months to over a year. A depression, on the other hand, is a much more severe and prolonged downturn characterized by a sustained drop in economic activity, extremely high unemployment, widespread business failures, and significant deflation." },
      { "id": 145, "question": "Explain what GDP, GNP and CPI is and how they're related.", "answer": "GDP (Gross Domestic Product) measures the total value of all goods and services produced within a country’s borders in a given time period, reflecting domestic economic activity. GNP (Gross National Product) includes GDP plus income earned by citizens and businesses abroad, minus income earned by foreigners domestically—giving a broader picture of a nation's economic performance. CPI (Consumer Price Index) tracks changes in the average price of a basket of consumer goods and services over time, serving as a key indicator of inflation and cost of living. Together, these metrics provide insight into economic growth, national income, and inflation trends." },
      { "id": 146, "question": "What are leading, coincident, and lagging economic indicators?", "answer": "Leading economic indicators are metrics that tend to change before the overall economy changes and are used to predict future economic activity; examples include stock market performance, new business permits, and consumer expectations. Coincident indicators change at the same time as the economy and reflect the current state; examples include employment levels, personal income, and industrial production. Lagging indicators change after the economy has already begun to follow a particular trend and help confirm patterns; examples include unemployment rates, corporate profits, and interest rates." },
      { "id": 147, "question": "Describe the four broad classes of industries.", "answer": "The four broad classes of industries are cyclical, non-cyclical (defensive), counter-cyclical, and growth or special situation. Cyclical industries perform well during economic expansions and poorly during recessions, such as automotive and construction. Non-cyclical (defensive) industries provide essential goods and services and remain stable across economic cycles, including sectors like utilities, food, and healthcare. Counter-cyclical industries tend to perform better during economic downturns, such as discount retailers or debt collection firms. Growth or special situation industries are characterized by unique factors—such as innovation, new products, or restructuring—that drive strong performance regardless of the economic cycle." },
      { "id": 148, "question": "Explain the balance sheet, including it's definition and its components.", "answer": "A balance sheet is a financial statement that provides a snapshot of a company’s financial position at a specific point in time. It shows what the company owns (assets), what it owes (liabilities), and the owner's equity (the residual interest in the assets after deducting liabilities). The balance sheet follows the accounting equation: Assets = Liabilities + Shareholders’ Equity. Key components include current and non-current assets (like cash, inventory, and property), current and long-term liabilities (such as accounts payable and debt), and equity items like retained earnings, common stock, preferred stock, capital in excess of par." },
      { "id": 149, "question": "What are three short-term and one long-term liquidity formulas to analyze a company's balance sheet and liquidity. Include the equation and significance of each formula.", "answer": "The three key short-term liquidity formulas are: (1) **Working Capital** = Current Assets - Current Liabilities. It represents the short-term financial buffer a company has to cover operational needs. Positive working capital indicates healthy liquidity. (2) **Current Ratio** = Current Assets / Current Liabilities. It measures the company’s ability to pay off its short-term obligations with its short-term assets. A ratio above 1 is generally favorable. (3) **Acid-Test (Quick) Ratio** = (Current Assets - Inventory) / Current Liabilities. This evaluates a company’s ability to meet short-term liabilities using its most liquid assets. The one long-term liquidity formula is: (4) **Debt Ratio** = Total Liabilities / Total Assets. It measures the proportion of a company’s assets that are financed by debt, reflecting long-term solvency and financial risk." },
      { "id": 150, "question": "Explain the income statement, including it's definition and its components.", "answer": "The income statement, also known as the profit and loss statement, shows a company’s financial performance over a specific period (e.g., quarter or year). It details how much revenue a company earned and the costs associated with earning that revenue. Key components include: (1) **Revenue (or Sales)** – total income from goods or services sold, (2) **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)** – direct costs of producing the goods or services, (3) **Gross Profit** – revenue minus COGS, (4) **Operating Expenses** – indirect costs such as salaries, rent, and utilities, (5) **Operating Income** – gross profit minus operating expenses, (6) **Other Income/Expenses** – non-operating items like interest or investment income, and (7) **Net Income** – the final profit after all expenses, taxes, and interest are deducted from total revenue." },
      { "id": 151, "question": "What are the two ratios to analyze an income statement and what do they measure?", "answer": "Two common ratios used to analyze an income statement are Earnings Per Share (EPS) and the Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio. **EPS** measures how much profit is allocated to each outstanding share of common stock and is calculated as Net Income minus Preferred Dividends divided by the number of Common Shares Outstanding. It reflects the company’s profitability on a per-share basis. **P/E Ratio** compares a company's stock price to its EPS and is calculated as Market Price per Share divided by EPS. It shows how much investors are willing to pay for each dollar of earnings and is used to assess whether a stock is overvalued or undervalued relative to its earnings." },
      { "id": 152, "question": "Describe how a strong and weak USD impacts the balance of payments for the USA.", "answer": "A strong U.S. dollar makes American goods and services more expensive for foreign buyers, which can reduce U.S. exports and increase imports, leading to a trade deficit and a negative impact on the balance of payments. Conversely, a weak U.S. dollar makes American exports cheaper and imports more expensive, which can boost exports, reduce imports, and improve the trade balance, positively affecting the balance of payments. Therefore, currency strength influences international demand for goods and the overall flow of money into and out of the country." },
      { "id": 153, "question": "Explain fiscal and monetary policy including Keynesian and Supply-Side Theories.", "answer": "Fiscal policy involves government decisions on taxation and spending to influence economic activity. Expansionary fiscal policy (increased spending or tax cuts) is used to stimulate growth, while contractionary policy (reduced spending or tax increases) slows inflation. Monetary policy, managed by the Federal Reserve, involves controlling the money supply and interest rates. Lower interest rates encourage borrowing and spending, while higher rates slow the economy to control inflation. Keynesian theory supports active government intervention through fiscal policy to manage demand and smooth economic cycles. In contrast, Supply-Side theory emphasizes tax cuts and deregulation to incentivize production, arguing that economic growth comes from boosting supply rather than demand." },
      { "id": 154, "question": "What are the Fed's diagnostic and direct tools?", "answer": "The Federal Reserve uses diagnostic tools to assess economic conditions and direct tools to influence monetary policy. The three diagnostic tools are the Consumer Price Index (CPI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and unemployment data—these help evaluate inflation, growth, and labor market health. The three direct tools are the reserve requirement (the percentage of deposits banks must hold in reserve), the discount rate (interest rate the Fed charges banks for short-term loans), and open market operations (buying or selling government securities to influence the money supply). By adjusting these tools, the Fed can either stimulate or contract the economy to meet its dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment." },
      { "id": 155, "question": "Describe the three measures of the money supply.", "answer": "The three primary measures of the money supply are M1, M2, and M3. M1 includes the most liquid forms of money, such as physical currency, demand deposits, and checking accounts. M2 includes all of M1 plus less liquid forms like savings accounts, money market accounts, and small time deposits under $100,000. M3 includes all of M2 plus large time deposits, institutional money market funds, and other large liquid assets. These measures help policymakers and economists track the availability of money in the economy and guide monetary policy decisions." },
      { "id": 156, "question": "Define the four major interest rates.", "answer": "The four major interest rates are: (1) The Federal Funds Rate, which is the interest rate banks charge each other for overnight loans of reserves and is influenced by the Federal Reserve; (2) The Discount Rate, which is the interest rate the Federal Reserve charges banks for borrowing directly from it; (3) The Prime Rate, which is the rate commercial banks charge their most creditworthy corporate customers and often serves as a benchmark for consumer loans; and (4) The Broker Loan Rate (or Call Loan Rate), which is the interest rate banks charge brokerage firms for loans used to finance margin accounts. These rates affect borrowing costs, investment decisions, and overall economic activity." }

      { "id": 157, "question": "How can an investor calculate his/her capital gains/losses?", "answer": "An investor calculates capital gains or losses by subtracting the cost basis (what was originally paid for the investment, including commissions or fees) from the sale price. The formula is: Capital Gain/Loss = Sale Price − Cost Basis. If the result is positive, it’s a capital gain; if negative, it’s a capital loss." },
      { "id": 158, "question": "Describe current yield.", "answer": "Current yield is a measure of the income provided by a bond relative to its current market price. It is calculated using the formula: Current Yield = Annual Interest Payment ÷ Current Market Price. It helps investors understand the return they can expect based on the bond’s current price, rather than its face value. Unlike yield to maturity, current yield does not account for any capital gains or losses if the bond is held to maturity." },
      { "id": 159, "question": "Describe total return.", "answer": "Total return measures the overall performance and profitability of an investment over a period of time, including both income and capital appreciation.

      { "id": 160, "question": "Differenciate realized and unrealized capital gains and losses.", "answer": "Realized capital gains and losses occur when an investment is actually sold, triggering a taxable event. These gains or losses must be reported on the investor’s tax return and are subject to short-term or long-term capital gains tax depending on the holding period. \n\nUnrealized capital gains and losses refer to the increase or decrease in the value of an investment that is still held and has not been sold. Since the investment has not been sold, no taxable event occurs, and these gains or losses only exist 'on paper.' Unrealized gains and losses can fluctuate over time and become realized only when the asset is sold." },
      { "id": 161, "question": "What are the three types of income?", "answer": "The three types of income are earned income, portfolio income, and passive income. Earned income comes from active work such as wages, salaries, and tips. Portfolio income is generated from investments like dividends, interest, and capital gains. Passive income is derived from rental properties, limited partnerships, or other enterprises in which the individual is not actively involved." },
      { "id": 162, "question": "Explain how net capital losses and net operating losses can offset capital gains, earned income, and carryforward.", "answer": "Net capital losses can first offset capital gains without limit. If any capital losses remain, up to $3,000 per year can be used to offset ordinary (earned) income, with the remainder carried forward indefinitely. Net operating losses (NOLs), typically from business income, can offset ordinary 80% of earned income but generally cannot offset capital gains unless the gains are directly connected to the business that generated the NOL. NOLs can be carried forward to offset future taxable income." },
      { "id": 163, "question": "Explain the uniqueness of passive income for taxation and write-offs.", "answer": "Passive income typically comes from activities in which the taxpayer does not materially participate, such as rental properties or limited partnerships. For tax purposes, passive income is taxed at ordinary income rates, but passive losses can generally only be used to offset passive income, not earned or portfolio income. Unused passive losses can be carried forward indefinitely to offset future passive income." },
      { "id": 164, "question": "Define a wash sale.", "answer": "A wash sale occurs when an investor sells a security at a loss and then repurchases the same or a substantially identical security within 30 days before or after the sale date. The IRS disallows the loss for tax purposes in these cases, meaning the investor cannot claim the loss on their taxes. Instead, the disallowed loss is added to the cost basis of the repurchased security, deferring the tax benefit until a future sale." }

      { "id": 165, "question": "Identify types of systemic risk.", "answer": "Systemic risk refers to the potential collapse of an entire financial system or market due to the failure of a single entity or group of entities that can trigger a broader economic breakdown. Types of systemic risk include market risk (the risk of overall market declines), interest rate risk (sensitivity to rate changes), inflation risk (loss of purchasing power), and geopolitical risk (market disruption due to political or global instability). These risks are non-diversifiable and affect all investments to some degree." },
      { "id": 166, "question": "Identify types of nonsystemic risk.", "answer": "Nonsystemic risk, also known as unsystematic or diversifiable risk, refers to risks that are specific to a particular company, industry, or sector and can be reduced through diversification. Types include credit risk (the chance a borrower will default), capital risk (the risk of losing invested principal), business risk (risks tied to a company’s operations and decisions), liquidity risk (difficulty selling an investment without impacting its price), regulatory risk (impact of rule changes by governing bodies), legislative risk (changes in laws that affect business operations or investments), and political/sovereign risk (instability or policy shifts in a country that affect investments)." },
      { "id": 167, "question": "Identify other types of investment risk.", "answer": "In addition to systemic and nonsystemic risks, investors may face other specific risks including call risk (the risk that a bond may be redeemed early by the issuer during falling interest rates), reinvestment risk (the risk that future proceeds will have to be reinvested at lower interest rates), prepayment risk (particularly in mortgage-backed securities, where borrowers may pay off loans early, reducing expected interest income), and currency risk (the risk that changes in exchange rates will negatively affect the value of international investments). These risks are important when evaluating fixed-income and global investment strategies." },
      { "id": 168, "question": "What are two strategies to mitigate systemic risk?", "answer": "Two strategies to mitigate systemic risk are diversification across asset classes and maintaining sufficient liquidity. Diversifying into asset classes less correlated with the broader market—such as commodities, real estate, or alternative investments—can help reduce exposure to widespread market downturns. Maintaining liquidity, such as holding cash or cash equivalents, ensures the ability to meet obligations or invest during periods of market stress." },
      { "id": 169, "question": "What are two strategies to mitigate nonsystemic risk?", "answer": "Two strategies to mitigate nonsystemic risk are diversification within sectors and thorough due diligence. By spreading investments across multiple companies, industries, or geographic regions, an investor reduces the impact of any single business failure or localized issue. Conducting due diligence—such as analyzing a company’s financials, management, and competitive position—also helps avoid taking on avoidable or excessive individual risk." },
      { "id": 170, "question": "What is the KYC (Know Your Customer) rule?", "answer": "The Know Your Customer (KYC) rule is a regulatory requirement that mandates financial firms to verify a customer’s identity, understand their financial profile, and assess the suitability of investment recommendations. It involves collecting information such as the customer’s age, income, net worth, risk tolerance, investment objectives, and tax status. KYC is critical for preventing fraud, money laundering, and ensuring that financial products align with the client’s best interests." },
      { "id": 171, "question": "What are the four component obligations that member firms must follow under the KYC rule?", "answer": "The four component obligations are: (1) Disclosure Obligation – requiring firms to provide full and fair disclosure of material facts related to recommendations; (2) Care Obligation – requiring firms to exercise reasonable diligence, care, and skill when making recommendations; (3) Conflict of Interest Obligation – requiring firms to identify, disclose, and mitigate or eliminate conflicts of interest; and (4) Compliance Obligation – requiring firms to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures to ensure compliance with Reg BI." }
